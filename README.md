# Semi-supervised and active learning with Gaussian fields
python implementation of Jerry Zhu's 2003 ICML paper on semi-supervised and active learning with Gaussian fields.

Original matlab code: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhuxj/pub/semisupervisedcode/active_learning/

All variables and documentation in the python file active_learning.py are kept the same as the original matlab code.

HAVE NOT TESTED YET. Example usage to come...
